# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function is not called when the component unmounts.  The problem is subtle and often related to premature unmounting or improper lifecycle management.  This example highlights the issue and provides a solution.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook is designed to perform side effects. The provided cleanup function is intended to be executed when the component is unmounted, allowing for cleanup of resources (e.g., timers, subscriptions, etc.). However, in certain scenarios, this cleanup function might not execute.

## Solution

The solution file demonstrates the correct usage of the `useEffect` hook to ensure the cleanup function executes upon unmounting.  The example also includes error handling and better logging practices for improved debugging. This can often be resolved by ensuring that you are correctly handling the component lifecycle.
